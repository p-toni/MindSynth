# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

## Core Concepts

### Supervised Learning
Uses labeled training data to learn patterns and make predictions on new, unseen data. Common examples include:
- Classification (predicting categories)
- Regression (predicting continuous values)

### Unsupervised Learning
Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples:
- Clustering (grouping similar data points)
- Dimensionality reduction
- Anomaly detection

### Reinforcement Learning
Agents learn through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

## Key Algorithms

**Linear Models**: Simple but powerful for many real-world problems
**Decision Trees**: Easy to interpret and visualize decision-making processes
**Neural Networks**: Flexible models inspired by biological neurons
**Support Vector Machines**: Effective for classification and regression tasks

## Data Preprocessing

Clean, transform, and prepare data before training:
- Handle missing values
- Normalize features
- Encode categorical variables
- Split into training/validation/test sets

## Model Evaluation

Assess performance using appropriate metrics:
- Accuracy, precision, recall for classification
- Mean squared error, R-squared for regression
- Cross-validation for robust estimates

## Practical Applications

Machine learning powers modern technology across industries:
- Recommendation systems
- Image and speech recognition
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
