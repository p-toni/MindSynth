# Design Principles

Good design is not about decoration but about communication and functionality.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Remove everything unnecessary
- **Consistency**: Maintain patterns throughout
- **Hierarchy**: Guide attention through visual weight
- **Balance**: Create stable and pleasing compositions
- **Contrast**: Make important elements stand out

True elegance comes from restraint and understanding of proportion. The best designs are often invisible, serving their purpose without drawing attention to themselves.
