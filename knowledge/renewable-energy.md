# Renewable Energy Technologies

The transition to renewable energy is both environmental necessity and economic opportunity.

## Technologies

- **Solar photovoltaic**: Direct sunlight to electricity
- **Wind turbines**: Kinetic energy to electrical energy
- **Hydroelectric**: Water flow drives generators
- **Geothermal**: Earth's heat for power and heating
- **Battery storage**: Solving intermittency challenges

## System Integration

- **Smart grids**: Intelligent energy distribution
- **Demand response**: Matching consumption to generation
- **Microgrids**: Local energy independence
- **Grid modernization**: Infrastructure for variable sources
- **Energy efficiency**: The cleanest energy is not used

The renewable transition requires not just new generation but reimagining how we produce, store, and consume energy across all sectors.
