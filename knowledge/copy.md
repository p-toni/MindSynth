# Welcome to Your Knowledge Base

This is a sample markdown file to demonstrate the semantic search functionality of your personal knowledge base.

## Getting Started

Your knowledge base supports:
- **Semantic Search**: Find content based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Markdown Support**: Full markdown formatting with headers, lists, and code
- **Ultra-lightweight**: The entire application is under 14kB
- **OpenAI Integration**: Powered by advanced embedding models

## Adding Content

To add more content to your knowledge base:

1. Create new `.md` files in the `knowledge/` directory
2. Run the build script: `python build.py`
3. Your new content will be automatically embedded and searchable

## Example Content

Here's some sample content you can search for:

### Machine Learning Concepts
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

### Python Programming
Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data science, and automation.

### Web Development
Modern web development involves creating responsive, fast, and user-friendly websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks.

Try searching for terms like "machine learning", "python", "web development", or ask questions like "How does AI work?" or "What is programming?"
