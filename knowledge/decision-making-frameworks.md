# Decision-Making Frameworks

Good decisions come from good processes, not just good judgment.

## Cognitive Biases

- **Confirmation bias**: Seeking information that confirms beliefs
- **Anchoring**: Over-relying on first information
- **Availability heuristic**: Overestimating memorable events
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing because of past investment
- **Analysis paralysis**: Overthinking prevents action

## Decision Frameworks

- **10-10-10 rule**: How will I feel in 10 minutes, months, years?
- **Pre-mortem**: Imagine failure and work backward
- **Opportunity cost**: What am I giving up?
- **Expected value**: Probability Ã— outcome for each option
- **Reversibility**: How easy is it to change course?

The goal is not perfect decisions but better decisions made more efficiently with less stress.
