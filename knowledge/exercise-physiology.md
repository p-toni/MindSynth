# Exercise Physiology

Understanding how the body responds to physical stress helps optimize training.

## Energy Systems

- **Phosphocreatine**: Immediate energy (0-10 seconds)
- **Glycolytic**: Short-term power (10 seconds - 2 minutes)
- **Oxidative**: Long-term endurance (2+ minutes)
- **Recovery**: How systems restore between efforts

## Adaptations

- **Cardiovascular**: Heart efficiency, blood volume
- **Muscular**: Strength, power, endurance
- **Metabolic**: Fat oxidation, lactate threshold
- **Neuromuscular**: Coordination, motor patterns

## Training Principles

- **Specificity**: Adaptations match training stress
- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase demands
- **Recovery**: Adaptation happens during rest
- **Individual variation**: Everyone responds differently

The body is remarkably adaptableâ€”consistent, intelligent training creates extraordinary capability over time.
