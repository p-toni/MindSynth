# Minimalism Philosophy

Minimalism is not about having less—it's about making room for what matters.

## Core Ideas

- **Intentionality**: Every possession should serve a purpose
- **Quality over quantity**: Choose fewer, better things
- **Experiences over objects**: Invest in memories, not stuff
- **Space**: Physical and mental clarity through reduction
- **Freedom**: Less maintenance, more flexibility

## Practical Application

- **One in, one out**: Maintain equilibrium
- **Regular purging**: Quarterly decluttering sessions
- **Digital minimalism**: Curate technology use
- **Mindful consumption**: Pause before purchasing
- **Multi-functional items**: Tools that serve multiple purposes

The goal is not austerity but abundance—having exactly what you need and nothing that distracts from what you value.
