# Productivity Systems

Effective productivity comes from systems, not motivation.

## Time Management

- **Time blocking**: Dedicate specific hours to specific tasks
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focused work sessions
- **Energy management**: Work with your natural rhythms
- **Single-tasking**: Focus on one thing at a time

## Task Organization

- **Getting Things Done (GTD)**: Capture, clarify, organize, reflect, engage
- **Eisenhower Matrix**: Urgent vs important decision framework
- **Kanban boards**: Visual workflow management

The key is finding a system that matches your thinking style and sticking with it consistently.
