# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled training data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Neural Networks**: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
- **Deep Learning**: Multi-layered neural networks for complex pattern recognition

The field combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract insights from data.
