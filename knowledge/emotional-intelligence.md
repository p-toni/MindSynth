# Emotional Intelligence

EQ often matters more than IQ for success in relationships and leadership.

## Four Domains

- **Self-awareness**: Recognizing your emotions and triggers
- **Self-regulation**: Managing impulses and reactions
- **Social awareness**: Reading others' emotions and needs
- **Relationship management**: Influencing and connecting

## Development Practices

- **Mindfulness**: Present-moment awareness of emotions
- **Journaling**: Processing and understanding patterns
- **Active listening**: Full attention to others' communication
- **Empathy**: Perspective-taking and compassion
- **Feedback**: Seeking and integrating others' perceptions

Emotions contain informationâ€”the key is learning to interpret and respond to them skillfully rather than being controlled by them.
