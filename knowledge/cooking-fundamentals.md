# Cooking Fundamentals

Good cooking starts with understanding ingredients and basic techniques.

## Essential Techniques

- **Knife skills**: Proper cutting for even cooking
- **Heat control**: Understanding when to use high, medium, low
- **Seasoning**: Salt, acid, fat, heat balance
- **Mise en place**: Preparation before cooking
- **Tasting**: Adjust flavors throughout the process

## Building Flavors

- **Aromatics**: Onions, garlic, ginger as base
- **Browning**: Maillard reaction for depth
- **Deglazing**: Capture fond for sauces
- **Layering**: Add ingredients at optimal times
- **Finishing**: Final touches that elevate dishes

Cooking is about transformationâ€”heat, time, and technique turning simple ingredients into something greater than the sum of their parts.
