# Effective Learning Strategies

Learning how to learn is the most valuable skill you can develop.

## Core Principles

- **Active recall**: Test yourself instead of re-reading
- **Spaced repetition**: Review material at increasing intervals
- **Interleaving**: Mix different topics in study sessions
- **Elaboration**: Connect new information to existing knowledge
- **Dual coding**: Combine visual and verbal information

## Techniques

- **Feynman Technique**: Explain concepts in simple terms
- **Mind mapping**: Visual organization of information
- **Pomodoro sessions**: Focused 25-minute study blocks
- **Sleep**: Consolidation happens during rest
- **Exercise**: Physical activity enhances cognitive function

The brain is plasticâ€”it changes based on how you use it. Deliberate practice in learning techniques improves retention and understanding across all domains.
