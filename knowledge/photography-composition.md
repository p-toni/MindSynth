# Photography Composition

Great photographs are made, not just taken. Composition guides the viewer's eye and conveys emotion.

## Classical Rules

- **Rule of thirds**: Place subjects along grid lines
- **Leading lines**: Direct attention through the frame
- **Framing**: Use elements to contain the subject
- **Symmetry**: Balance and harmony
- **Patterns**: Repetition creates visual interest

## Advanced Techniques

- **Negative space**: What's not there is as important as what is
- **Color theory**: Complementary and analogous relationships
- **Depth of field**: Control focus for emphasis
- **Golden hour**: Light quality transforms ordinary scenes
- **Breaking rules**: Know principles to violate them intentionally

The camera is just a toolâ€”the photograph happens in the photographer's mind and heart before the shutter clicks.
