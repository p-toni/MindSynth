# Toni Pereira

I build products where **AI, software integrity, and human judgment** meet. My lens is first principles: define the *why*, expose constraints, instrument the loop, and use AI to search the solution space faster. The goal isn’t automation for its own sake; it’s **augmentation**—better questions, tighter feedback, more reliable outcomes.

## How I work
- **Clarity first.** Translate fuzzy goals into testable hypotheses and guardrails; pick the smallest slice that proves value.
- **Observable workflows.** Traceable inputs → steps → outputs; stochastic exploration to widen options, deterministic checks where decisions matter.
- **Human-in-the-loop by design.** Keep people as goal-setters and editors; use AI for proposals, drafts, counter-examples, and stress tests.
- **Instrumentation over intuition.** Ship with evaluators, logs, and quality checks; iterate on real signals, not vibes.
- **Integrity is a feature.** Reliability, safety, explainability, and security are product requirements—not add-ons.

## What I do
- Lead product end-to-end: problem framing, exploratory prototypes, measurable launches, and continuous evaluation.
- Design **human–AI** workflows that amplify judgment (co-drafting, counter-pattern search, auto-evaluators/guardrails).
- Build systems that connect text, data, and code so teams spend less time searching and more time **synthesizing**.

## Selected work
- **MindSynth.** A minimal personal knowledge tool with **semantic search** and a **dot-based visualization** to surface non-obvious connections—built to externalize thinking and make pattern discovery feel effortless. 

## Background (snapshot)
Product leadership across AI, data, and platform integrity; founder experience; earlier stints in analytics and growth. Recent roles span large-scale orgs and startups, with impact anchored in instrumentation, reliability, and user-centric design.

## Elsewhere
- Writing/notes: MindSynth repo + personal knowledge garden.

> I treat intelligence as guided search: humans keep the *why* and the standards; machines expand the search and tighten the loop.
