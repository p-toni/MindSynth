# Welcome to MindSynth

Your personal knowledge universe is now ready! MindSynth transforms how you discover and connect ideas through semantic search.

## How It Works

Every markdown file you add becomes part of your searchable knowledge graph. The AI understands meaning, not just keywords, creating a web of interconnected thoughts.

## Getting Started

1. **Add Knowledge**: Drop `.md` files in the `knowledge/` directory
2. **Create PR**: Your changes trigger automated processing  
3. **Merge**: Embeddings generate automatically
4. **Search**: Ideas become instantly discoverable

## The Philosophy

> *"A place for ideas to find each other"*

MindSynth believes knowledge thrives through connection. The dot-based visualization shows not just what you're searching for, but the strength of relationships between concepts.

Your thoughts deserve a home that understands them. Welcome to deeper discovery.
