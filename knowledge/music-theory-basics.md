# Music Theory Basics

Music theory provides a language for understanding how music works.

## Fundamental Elements

- **Notes**: The building blocks (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
- **Intervals**: Distance between notes
- **Scales**: Patterns of intervals that create moods
- **Chords**: Multiple notes played together
- **Rhythm**: The timing of musical events

## Key Concepts

- **Circle of Fifths**: Relationship between key signatures
- **Major vs Minor**: Happy vs sad tonal qualities
- **Chord Progressions**: Common sequences that sound good
- **Voice Leading**: How individual parts move between chords

Understanding theory doesn't make music mechanicalâ€”it provides tools for more expressive and intentional composition.
