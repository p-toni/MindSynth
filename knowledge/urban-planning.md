# Urban Planning Principles

Good cities are designed for people, not just cars.

## Key Elements

- **Mixed-use development**: Live, work, shop in proximity
- **Walkability**: Pedestrian-friendly streets and spaces
- **Public transit**: Efficient movement without cars
- **Green spaces**: Parks, trees, natural areas
- **Density**: Efficient land use while maintaining quality of life

## Design Approaches

- **New Urbanism**: Traditional neighborhood development
- **Transit-oriented development**: Building around public transport
- **Complete streets**: Infrastructure for all users
- **Tactical urbanism**: Small, temporary improvements
- **Participatory planning**: Community involvement in decisions

Cities are humanity's greatest inventionâ€”concentrating people, ideas, and resources while minimizing environmental impact per person when designed thoughtfully.
