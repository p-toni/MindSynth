# The Craft of Writing

Writing is thinking made visible. Good writing serves the reader, not the writer's ego.

## Principles

- **Clarity**: Say what you mean simply
- **Concision**: Every word must earn its place
- **Voice**: Develop your authentic perspective
- **Revision**: Writing is rewriting
- **Reading**: Study great writers to learn the craft

## Process

1. **First draft**: Get ideas down without judgment
2. **Structure**: Organize thoughts logically
3. **Polish**: Refine language and rhythm
4. **Edit**: Cut unnecessary words ruthlessly

The best writing feels effortless to read but requires enormous effort to create.
