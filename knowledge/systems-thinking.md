# Systems Thinking

Understanding how parts interact within wholes reveals leverage points for change.

## Key Concepts

- **Feedback loops**: How outputs become inputs
- **Emergence**: System properties that parts don't have
- **Non-linearity**: Small changes can have big effects
- **Mental models**: Our assumptions about how things work
- **Leverage points**: Where small shifts yield big changes

## Tools

- **Causal loop diagrams**: Map cause and effect relationships
- **Stock and flow models**: Track accumulations over time
- **Rich pictures**: Visual representation of complex situations
- **Systems archetypes**: Common problematic patterns
- **Iceberg model**: Events, patterns, structures, mental models

Problems often persist because we treat symptoms instead of addressing root causes in system structure.
