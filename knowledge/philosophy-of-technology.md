# Philosophy of Technology

Technology is not neutralâ€”it shapes how we think, relate, and perceive the world.

## Key Questions

- How do tools change the user?
- What values are embedded in technological systems?
- How does digital life affect human consciousness?
- What is the relationship between efficiency and meaning?

## Thinkers

- **Martin Heidegger**: Technology as revealing and concealing
- **Jacques Ellul**: The autonomous nature of technological systems
- **Neil Postman**: Technology as ecology, not tool
- **Sherry Turkle**: Digital relationships and authentic connection

We shape our tools, then they shape us. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for thoughtful engagement with technology.
